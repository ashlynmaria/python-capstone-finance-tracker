# Personal Finance Tracker

A simple command-line Python application to log personal expenses, categorize them, and view summaries. This project demonstrates core Python skills and robust exception handling for a smooth user experience.

## Overview
The Personal Finance Tracker allows users to:
- ➕ Add an expense with a description, category, and amount.
- 📋 View all recorded expenses by category.
- 📊 View a summary of total spending per category.
- ❌ Exit the program cleanly.

The application ensures that all user inputs are validated and handles unexpected errors gracefully.

## How to Run
1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Ensure you have **Python 3.6 or higher** installed.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 finance_tracker.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen menu prompts to add expenses, view all entries, view summaries, or exit.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Variables & Data Types**: strings, floats, dictionaries, lists, tuples.
- **Control Structures**: `if`/`elif`/`else` branching.
- **Loops**: `while` loops for menus and input prompts.
- **Functions**: modular code organization with reusable functions.
- **String Operations**: input handling, formatting, docstrings.
- **Collections**: lists and dictionaries to store and organize data.
- **Exception Handling**: `try`/`except` blocks for input validation and unexpected errors.
- **System Exit**: `sys.exit()` calls to terminate the program cleanly.
- **Docstrings & Comments**: inline documentation for clarity.
